# Audio Restoration & Cleanup

Audio restoration and cleanup encompasses specialized techniques for removing unwanted noise, repairing damaged audio, and enhancing clarity in recordings. This skill focuses on advanced methods including spectral editing, targeted noise reduction, and archival restoration techniques that go beyond basic audio editing to salvage and perfect problematic recordings.

## Core Concepts

### Understanding Audio Restoration

Audio restoration is the process of improving audio quality by:

- **Removing unwanted sounds**: Background noise, hum, clicks, pops, crackle
- **Repairing damaged audio**: Dropouts, distortion, clipping
- **Enhancing clarity**: Improving intelligibility and presence
- **Preserving authenticity**: Maintaining original character while improving quality
- **Archival work**: Restoring historical recordings for preservation

### Distinction from Basic Audio Restoration

While basic audio restoration covers fundamental noise reduction and cleanup, this advanced skill focuses on:

- **Spectral editing**: Visual frequency-based editing for surgical precision
- **Complex noise patterns**: Handling variable and intermittent noise
- **Severe damage repair**: Reconstructing missing or corrupted audio
- **Archival techniques**: Specialized methods for historical recordings
- **Advanced tool mastery**: Deep knowledge of professional restoration software

### Types of Audio Problems

**Steady-State Noise**
- Consistent background sounds (hiss, hum, buzz)
- Air conditioning, computer fans, traffic
- Electrical interference (50/60 Hz hum)
- Tape hiss from analog recordings

**Intermittent Noise**
- Sudden, unpredictable sounds
- Coughs, door slams, phone rings
- Wind gusts, passing vehicles
- Handling noise, cable bumps

**Impulse Noise**
- Brief, sharp sounds
- Clicks and pops (vinyl records, digital errors)
- Crackle (damaged media)
- Mouth clicks in dialogue

**Distortion and Clipping**
- Overloaded signal causing waveform distortion
- Digital clipping (flat-topped waveforms)
- Analog saturation
- Intermodulation distortion

**Frequency-Specific Issues**
- Resonances and room modes
- Electrical hum and harmonics
- Sibilance (excessive "s" sounds)
- Low-frequency rumble

**Temporal Issues**
- Dropouts (missing audio segments)
- Phase problems
- Timing inconsistencies
- Reverb and echo

## Noise Reduction Techniques

### Spectral Noise Reduction

**Principle**: Analyzes frequency spectrum to identify and reduce noise while preserving desired signal.

**Process**:

1. **Noise Profile Capture**
   - Select section containing only noise (no signal)
   - Software analyzes frequency characteristics
   - Creates "noise print" or profile
   - Typically 1-3 seconds of pure noise needed

2. **Threshold Setting**
   - Determines how much reduction to apply
   - Higher threshold = more aggressive reduction
   - Balance between noise removal and artifact introduction
   - Start conservative, increase gradually

3. **Frequency Resolution**
   - Higher resolution = more precise but slower processing
   - Lower resolution = faster but less precise
   - Adjust based on noise characteristics

4. **Smoothing**
   - Reduces "musical noise" artifacts
   - Blends frequency bands
   - Higher smoothing = fewer artifacts but less precision

**Best Practices**:
- Capture noise profile from representative section
- Process in multiple passes with moderate settings
- Monitor for artifacts (metallic, underwater sounds)
- Preserve natural ambience
- Use bypass to compare before/after

### Adaptive Noise Reduction

**Principle**: Continuously analyzes and adapts to changing noise characteristics.

**Advantages**:
- Handles variable noise levels
- Adapts to changing environments
- Reduces need for manual profiling
- Better for long-form content

**Parameters**:
- **Adaptation speed**: How quickly algorithm responds to changes
- **Sensitivity**: Threshold for detecting noise vs. signal
- **Preservation**: Amount of original signal retained

**Applications**:
- Location recordings with variable background
- Long interviews or podcasts
- Live recordings
- Documentary footage

### De-Hum and De-Buzz

**Electrical Interference**:
- 50 Hz (Europe, Asia, Africa) or 60 Hz (Americas) fundamental
- Harmonics at multiples (120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, etc.)
- Caused by power lines, lighting, equipment

**Removal Techniques**:

1. **Notch Filtering**
   - Narrow filters at fundamental and harmonics
   - Surgical removal of specific frequencies
   - Minimal impact on surrounding frequencies
   - May need 6-10 notches for all harmonics

2. **Adaptive De-Hum**
   - Automatically detects and removes hum
   - Tracks frequency variations
   - Adjusts to changing hum characteristics
   - Preferred for variable hum

3. **Spectral Editing**
   - Visual identification of hum frequencies
   - Manual selection and reduction
   - Precise control over affected regions
   - Best for complex cases

**Best Practices**:
- Identify all harmonic frequencies
- Use narrow Q (bandwidth) for notch filters
- Monitor for over-processing
- Check entire frequency spectrum
- Preserve nearby frequencies

### De-Click and De-Crackle

**Sources**:
- Vinyl record damage
- Digital transmission errors
- Mouth clicks in dialogue
- Electrical interference

**De-Click**:
- Detects and removes individual clicks
- Analyzes waveform for sudden amplitude changes
- Interpolates replacement audio from surrounding samples
- Adjustable sensitivity and threshold

**Parameters**:
- **Sensitivity**: How easily clicks are detected
- **Threshold**: Minimum amplitude to trigger detection
- **Click width**: Maximum duration considered a click
- **Output**: Removed clicks only (for verification)

**De-Crackle**:
- Addresses dense, continuous crackling
- More aggressive than de-click
- Smooths waveform while preserving transients
- Risk of dulling high frequencies

**Best Practices**:
- Start with low sensitivity
- Process in multiple passes
- Verify removed clicks (solo output)
- Preserve intentional transients (drums, percussion)
- Use spectral editing for stubborn clicks

### De-Clip and De-Distortion

**Clipping**: Waveform exceeds maximum amplitude, causing flat-topped distortion

**De-Clip Process**:
1. **Detection**: Identifies clipped samples
2. **Reconstruction**: Estimates original waveform shape
3. **Interpolation**: Fills in clipped portions
4. **Harmonics reduction**: Removes distortion artifacts

**Limitations**:
- Cannot fully restore severely clipped audio
- Works best on mild to moderate clipping
- May introduce artifacts
- Some harmonic distortion remains

**De-Distortion**:
- Reduces harmonic distortion
- Analyzes and removes added harmonics
- Limited effectiveness on severe distortion
- Best for mild analog saturation

**Prevention Note**: Proper gain staging prevents clipping; restoration is damage control.

### De-Reverb and De-Echo

**Reverb**: Diffuse reflections creating ambient sound
**Echo**: Distinct, delayed repetitions

**De-Reverb Techniques**:
- Analyzes reverb characteristics
- Reduces reverb tail and reflections
- Preserves direct sound
- Improves dialogue intelligibility

**Parameters**:
- **Reduction amount**: How much reverb to remove
- **Reverb time**: Estimated decay time
- **Frequency range**: Which frequencies to process
- **Artifact suppression**: Reduces processing artifacts

**Applications**:
- Dialogue recorded in reverberant spaces
- Improving clarity for broadcast
- Matching ambience across shots
- Preparing audio for re-reverb

**Limitations**:
- Cannot completely remove reverb
- May introduce artifacts
- Works best on moderate reverb
- Requires careful parameter adjustment

## Spectral Editing

### Understanding Spectrograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of audio showing:
- **X-axis**: Time
- **Y-axis**: Frequency
- **Color/Brightness**: Amplitude (loudness)

**Reading Spectrograms**:
- Bright areas = loud frequencies
- Dark areas = quiet frequencies
- Horizontal lines = sustained tones
- Vertical lines = transients (drums, clicks)
- Patterns reveal noise, speech, music characteristics

**Spectrogram Settings**:
- **FFT size**: Frequency resolution (larger = more detail)
- **Window size**: Time resolution (smaller = better time accuracy)
- **Color scale**: Linear or logarithmic display
- **Frequency range**: Full spectrum or zoomed view

### Spectral Selection and Editing

**Selection Tools**:

1. **Rectangular Selection**
   - Select time and frequency range
   - Good for sustained tones (hum, resonances)
   - Precise frequency targeting

2. **Lasso/Freehand Selection**
   - Draw custom shapes around noise
   - Ideal for irregular noise patterns
   - Follows contours of unwanted sounds

3. **Magic Wand/Threshold Selection**
   - Automatically selects similar frequencies
   - Based on amplitude threshold
   - Quick selection of consistent noise

4. **Harmonic Selection**
   - Selects fundamental and harmonics
   - Useful for tonal noise (hum, whistles)
   - Automatically calculates harmonic series

**Editing Operations**:

1. **Attenuation**
   - Reduce amplitude of selected frequencies
   - Adjustable reduction amount (dB)
   - Preserves some original character
   - Most common operation

2. **Deletion**
   - Complete removal of selected frequencies
   - Creates silence in selected region
   - Risk of creating "holes" in spectrum
   - Use sparingly

3. **Interpolation**
   - Fills selection with surrounding frequencies
   - Smooths transitions
   - Reduces artifacts
   - Good for small regions

4. **Noise Reduction**
   - Applies noise reduction to selection only
   - Targeted processing
   - Preserves rest of spectrum

### Spectral Repair

**Principle**: Reconstructs damaged or missing audio using surrounding spectral information.

**Applications**:

1. **Dropout Repair**
   - Fills gaps in audio
   - Analyzes surrounding frequencies
   - Synthesizes replacement audio
   - Seamless transitions

2. **Artifact Removal**
   - Removes specific unwanted sounds
   - Dog barks, phone rings, sirens
   - Surgical precision
   - Minimal impact on desired audio
