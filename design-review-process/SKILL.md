2. Note first impression (positive/negative/neutral)
3. Identify what draws attention first
4. Assess if primary action is clear

### Element-by-Element Review

#### Typography
- [ ] Is body text readable (16px+)?
- [ ] Is heading hierarchy clear (3+ levels)?
- [ ] Is line length comfortable (60-75 chars)?
- [ ] Is line height appropriate (1.5-1.7 for body)?
- [ ] Are fonts loading correctly?

#### Color
- [ ] Does palette feel cohesive?
- [ ] Is there sufficient contrast?
- [ ] Is color used meaningfully (not decoratively)?
- [ ] Are semantic colors correct (green=success)?
- [ ] Would it work for colorblind users?

#### Layout
- [ ] Is grid usage consistent?
- [ ] Is alignment precise?
- [ ] Is whitespace intentional?
- [ ] Is visual balance achieved?
- [ ] Does layout guide the eye?

#### Components
- [ ] Are all states designed?
- [ ] Are components consistent?
- [ ] Are interactive elements clear?

```

### Step 3: UX Evaluation

**User-centered review:**

```markdown

## UX Evaluation
### Task Completion
For each key user task:
1. Can user identify where to start?
2. Is the path to completion clear?
3. Is progress communicated?
4. Is completion confirmed?

### Cognitive Load
- Is information chunked appropriately?
- Are users overloaded with options?
- Is important info prioritized?
- Can users focus on one task?

### Wayfinding
- Is current location clear?
- Can users navigate to any section?
- Are breadcrumbs/back paths available?
- Is search available if needed?

### Error Handling
- Are potential errors prevented?
- Are error messages helpful?
- Can users recover easily?
- Is data preserved on errors?
```
