### Step 1: Define Search Strategy

**Prompt to create search plan:**
```
Based on this project context:
- Project type: [TYPE]
- Industry: [INDUSTRY]
- Target audience: [AUDIENCE]

Create a search strategy with:
1. 5-10 specific Dribbble search queries
2. 3-5 general web search queries for inspiration
3. Key visual elements to look for (colors, typography, layouts)
4. Design patterns relevant to this project type
```

### Step 2: Search Dribbble

```
Search Dribbble for "[QUERY]" and identify:
1. Top 5 visually striking examples
2. Common patterns across results
3. Color trends in this category

### Overall Visual Direction
Clean, sophisticated minimal design with subtle warmth. Emphasis on white 
space, precise typography, and functional elegance. Small delightful 
details (micro-interactions, subtle gradients) add personality without 
clutter. The aesthetic should feel premium and calm - a tool that reduces 
stress, not adds to it.

### Reference Analysis

#### Linear.app Analysis

**Typography**:
- Sans-serif throughout (Inter-like)
- Tight letter-spacing in headings
- Clean hierarchy with size contrast

**What to adapt**:
- Precision in spacing and alignment
- Subtle gradient accents
- Minimal but effective use of color
- Command palette aesthetic

#### Notion.so Analysis

### Color Direction (Combining References)
| Role | Color | Hex | Reference |
|------|-------|-----|----------|
| Background | White | #FFFFFF | Both |
| Surface | Light Gray | #F8F9FA | Linear |
| Primary | Warm Purple | #8B5CF6 | Linear+warm |
| Text Primary | Near Black | #1A1A1A | Linear |
| Text Secondary | Gray | #6B7280 | Both |
| Accent Warm | Soft Amber | #F59E0B | Notion warmth |

### Typography Direction
- Headings: Inter or Satoshi (geometric, modern)
- Body: Inter (proven readability)
- Consider: Slight warmth in weights, not too mechanical

### Layout Patterns to Follow
1. **Hero**: Large typography, subtle illustration, clear CTA (Linear style)
2. **Features**: Card grid with icons, generous padding
3. **Screenshots**: Floating with subtle shadow, perspective
4. **Pricing**: Simple table, highlight recommended

### Components to Design
| Component | Reference Style | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Navigation | Linear - minimal, right-aligned CTA | |
| Hero | Linear + illustration warmth | |
| Feature cards | Notion - warm, icon-led | |
| Testimonials | Linear - minimal, photo + quote | |
| Footer | Simple, organized columns | |

### Unique Elements Worth Including
1. **Floating UI preview** (Linear style) - shows product without full screenshot
2. **Warm gradient accent** - subtle, adds life to minimal design
3. **Playful illustrations** (Notion style) - humanizes the product
4. **Keyboard shortcut hints** - appeals to power users

### Anti-patterns to Avoid
- Too cold/clinical (pure Linear without warmth)
- Too playful/casual (would undermine premium feel)
- Dense information (overwhelming for target audience)
- Generic stock photos (contradicts creative agency audience)
```
