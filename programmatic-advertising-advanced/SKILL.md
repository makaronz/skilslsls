## Advanced Targeting Strategies

### First-Party Data Activation

1. **Data Onboarding** — upload customer lists (emails, addresses, MAIDs) to DSP
2. **Matching** — DSP matches to cookie IDs, device IDs, or household IDs (40-70% match rates)
3. **Segmentation** — create segments by customer value, behavior, lifecycle stage
4. **Activation** — target, suppress, or create lookalikes from segments

**Data Onboarding Partners**
- LiveRamp (largest, 70%+ match rates)
- Neustar
- Experian
- Acxiom

### Lookalike Modeling

**Seed Audience Requirements**
- Minimum 1,000 users (10,000+ recommended)
- High-quality data (recent, accurate)
- Specific segment (best customers, not all customers)

**Lookalike Percentages**
- 1% — Most similar, smallest reach, highest conversion rate
- 5% — Balanced similarity and reach
- 10% — Broader reach, lower similarity
- 20%+ — Maximum reach, lowest similarity

**Optimization**
- Test multiple percentages simultaneously
- Monitor conversion rates by percentage
- Expand to higher percentages as performance allows

### Contextual Targeting 2.0

**Beyond Keywords**
- Semantic analysis (understand content meaning, not just keywords)
- Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral content)
- Brand safety categories (exclude inappropriate content)
- Content quality scores (premium vs. low-quality sites)

**Contextual Targeting Providers**
- Oracle (Grapeshot) — comprehensive contextual categories
- Peer39 — semantic analysis and brand safety
- Integral Ad Science (IAS) — contextual + brand safety
- DoubleVerify — contextual + brand safety

### Predictive Audiences

- Available in most major DSPs

## Advanced Bidding Strategies

### Bidding Algorithms

**Fixed CPM**
- Set maximum CPM bid
- Simple, predictable
- Good for awareness campaigns
- No optimization

**Dynamic CPM**
- DSP adjusts bids based on likelihood to achieve goal
- Optimizes for clicks, viewability, or completion rate
- Good for consideration campaigns
- Requires learning period (1-2 weeks)

**CPC (Cost Per Click)**
- Pay only for clicks
- DSP optimizes bids to achieve target CPC
- Good for traffic campaigns
- Requires sufficient click volume

**CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)**
- Pay for conversions (or optimize to target CPA)
- DSP uses machine learning to predict conversion likelihood
- Good for conversion campaigns
- Requires minimum 50-100 conversions per week
- 2-4 week learning period

**ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
- Optimize bids to achieve target ROAS
- Requires revenue tracking
- Good for e-commerce campaigns
- Requires significant conversion volume (100+ per week)
- 2-4 week learning period

### Bid Modifiers

**Dayparting**
- Increase bids during high-performing hours
- Decrease bids during low-performing hours
- Example: +50% bid modifier for 6-10pm, -30% for 2-6am

**Geographic**
- Increase bids in high-performing markets
- Decrease bids in low-performing markets
- Example: +40% for top 10 DMAs, -20% for bottom 20 DMAs

**Device**
- Adjust bids by device type (desktop, mobile, tablet, CTV)
- Example: +30% for mobile, -10% for desktop

**Audience**
- Increase bids for high-value audiences
- Decrease bids for low-value audiences
- Example: +100% for first-party customers, +50% for lookalikes

**Frequency**
- Adjust bids based on how many times user has seen ad
- Example: +20% for first impression, -50% for 5+ impressions

### Bid Shading

**What is Bid Shading?**
- Technique to reduce CPMs in first-price auctions
- DSP bids less than maximum to avoid overpaying
- Uses historical data to predict winning bid price

**When to Use**
- First-price auctions (most programmatic inventory)
- When CPMs are higher than expected
- When win rates are very high (>50%)

**Implementation**
- Most DSPs have automatic bid shading
- Can adjust aggressiveness (conservative vs. aggressive shading)
- Monitor win rates (should be 20-40%)

## Supply Path Optimization (SPO)

### What is SPO?

Supply Path Optimization is the practice of identifying and prioritizing the most efficient paths to reach publisher inventory, reducing intermediaries and costs.

### SPO Benefits

- **Lower CPMs**: Fewer intermediaries = lower fees
- **Higher Transparency**: Know exactly where ads run
- **Better Performance**: Direct relationships with quality publishers
- **Reduced Fraud**: Fewer hops = less fraud risk

### SPO Implementation

**1. Analyze Supply Paths**
- Review all SSPs and exchanges in DSP
- Identify duplicate inventory (same impression available via multiple paths)
- Calculate effective CPM by path (media cost + fees)

**2. Identify Preferred Paths**
- Prioritize direct SSP relationships
- Prefer paths with fewer intermediaries
- Choose paths with best performance (completion rates, viewability, etc.)

**3. Consolidate Spending**
- Focus spend on 3-5 preferred SSPs
- Negotiate better rates with preferred partners
- Block or reduce spend on inefficient paths

**4. Monitor and Optimize**
- Continuously review supply path performance
- Adjust preferred paths based on results
- Test new SSPs periodically

### Major SSPs (Supply-Side Platforms)

- **Google Ad Manager (AdX)** — Largest SSP, access to Google inventory
- **Magnite (Rubicon + Telaria)** — Large independent SSP, strong in CTV
- **PubMatic** — Independent SSP, strong in mobile and video
- **OpenX** — Independent SSP, premium publishers
- **Index Exchange** — Large SSP, header bidding focus
- **Amazon Publisher Services (APS)** — Amazon's SSP, Fire TV access

## Private Marketplace (PMP) Strategies

### PMP Benefits

- **Quality Inventory**: Curated, brand-safe inventory
- **Transparency**: Know exactly where ads run
- **Priority Access**: First look at premium inventory
- **Negotiated Pricing**: Fixed or floor pricing
- **Direct Relationships**: Work directly with publishers

### PMP Deal Types

**Open Auction PMP**
- Invitation-only auction
- Multiple buyers compete
- Floor price set by publisher
- Winner pays second-price or first-price

**Private Auction**
- Invitation-only auction
- Buyers get first look before open exchange
- If no PMP buyer wins, goes to open exchange

**Preferred Deal**
- Fixed price, no auction
- First look at inventory
- If buyer doesn't take impression, goes to auction
- No guaranteed volume

**Programmatic Guaranteed**
- Fixed price, guaranteed volume
- Reserved inventory (like traditional IO)
- Automated delivery and reporting
- No auction

### PMP Negotiation Process

**1. Identify Target Publishers**
- Research publishers that reach target audience
- Prioritize premium, brand-safe publishers
- Consider niche publishers for specific audiences

**2. Reach Out**
- Contact publisher directly or via DSP rep
- Express interest in PMP partnership
- Share campaign objectives and budget

**3. Negotiate Terms**
- Pricing (CPM floor or fixed CPM)
- Volume commitments (if any)
- Targeting parameters (audience, geography, etc.)
- Creative specifications
- Reporting and measurement

**4. Set Up Deal**
- Publisher creates deal ID in SSP
- Add deal ID to DSP
- Test with small budget
- Scale if performance meets expectations

**5. Monitor and Optimize**
- Review performance weekly
- Adjust bids and budgets
- Renegotiate terms if needed
- Expand to additional publishers

## Fraud Prevention & Brand Safety

### Types of Ad Fraud

**Invalid Traffic (IVT)**
- Bots and spiders
