# Design Iteration & Refinement

Systematically improve designs based on review findings and score gaps through prioritized, focused changes.

## Overview

Design Iteration is the systematic process of improving designs based on review findings and score gaps. This skill ensures each iteration moves closer to the quality target (typically 9/10) through focused, prioritized changes. It covers issue prioritization, iteration planning, change execution, and validation.

## When to Use

- After design review identifies issues
- When design score is below the target (e.g., below 9/10)
- To address specific feedback from stakeholders
- During refinement phase before handoff
- When iterating between review and scoring cycles

## Impact/Effort Priority Matrix

| Quadrant | Impact | Effort | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Do First** 🟢 | High | Low | Significant quality improvement with minimal work |
| **Schedule** 🟡 | High | High | Important but requires significant work |
| **Quick Wins** 🟢 | Low | Low | Small polish improvements |
| **Defer** 🟠 | Low | High | Consider if worth the effort, may skip |

Always address **Do First** items in the current iteration. Schedule **High Impact, High Effort** items if time allows. Batch **Quick Wins** together. Defer or eliminate low-value high-effort work.

## Iteration Plan Template

```markdown
## Iteration Plan: V[X] → V[X+1]

### Goal
Move from [current score] to [target score]

### In Scope (This Iteration)
- [Change 1] | Expected impact: +[X] | Effort: [Xh]
- [Change 2] | Expected impact: +[X] | Effort: [Xh]
- [Change 3] | Expected impact: +[X] | Effort: [Xh]

### Out of Scope (Next Iteration)
- [Deferred item 1]
- [Deferred item 2]

### Expected Outcome
- Score improvement: +[X] points
- Target score: [X]/10
```

## Change Documentation

For each change, document:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Short descriptive name |
| **Category** | Visual / UX / Consistency / Accessibility / Brand |
| **Issue** | What was wrong |
| **Solution** | What was changed |
| **Before** | Previous state (values, specs) |
| **After** | New state (values, specs) |
| **Impact** | Expected score improvement |

## Common Iteration Categories

### Typography Fixes
- Adjust line-heights (body: 1.5→1.6, headings: 1.1→1.2–1.3)
- Increase heading size differentiation
- Fix line length (target 60–75 characters)

### Shadow & Border Standardization
- Define shadow scale: sm, md, lg
- Apply consistently to all elevated elements
- Standardize border-radius across component types

### Focus State Enhancement
- Add visible focus ring (e.g., 3px colored outline)
- Ensure all interactive elements have focus states
- Test keyboard navigation order

### Mobile Refinement
- Increase touch targets to 48px minimum
- Add swipe actions for common operations
- Implement pull-to-refresh where appropriate
- Redesign navigation for thumb-zone accessibility

### Empty & Loading States
- Design skeleton loaders for content areas
- Add illustrations and CTAs to empty states
- Design error states with recovery actions

## Validation Checklist

After completing iteration changes:

### Issue Resolution
- [ ] Each planned issue is verified fixed
- [ ] Fix addresses the root cause, not just symptoms

### No Regressions
- [ ] Previous strengths are maintained
- [ ] No new issues introduced by changes
- [ ] Consistency not broken across screens

### Quality Check
- [ ] Quick visual scan passes (5-second test)
- [ ] Primary flows still work correctly
- [ ] Responsive behavior intact at all breakpoints

### Ready for Re-scoring
- [ ] All planned changes complete
- [ ] Documentation updated with changes
- [ ] Ready for next review/scoring cycle

## Iteration Cadence

| Iteration | Focus | Target Score |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| V1 → V2 | Critical fixes (loading, mobile nav, focus) | 7.5/10 |
| V2 → V3 | Important improvements (hierarchy, spacing, indicators) | 8.5/10 |
| V3 → V4 | Polish (micro-interactions, edge cases, accessibility) | 9.0/10 |

Each iteration should be scoped to 4–8 hours of work maximum. Smaller, frequent iterations are better than large infrequent ones.

## Best Practices

1. **Fix the highest-impact issues first** — Don't polish details while critical issues remain
2. **One iteration, one focus** — Don't try to fix everything at once
3. **Document before/after** — Makes review of changes clear and reversible
4. **Re-score after each iteration** — Track progress quantitatively
5. **Don't over-iterate** — Diminishing returns after 3–4 iterations; ship and learn
6. **Preserve what works** — Don't break strengths while fixing weaknesses

## Using the Reference Files

### When to Read Each Reference

**`/references/iteration-planning-examples.md`** — Read when planning a specific iteration, needing concrete examples of before/after changes, or tracking expected score impact across categories.

**`/references/change-implementation-patterns.md`** — Read when implementing specific design changes (typography, shadows, focus states, mobile) and needing detailed CSS specifications and design token updates.

**`/references/iteration-prompts.md`** — Read when needing AI prompts for iteration planning, change implementation, or post-iteration validation.

**`/references/iteration-prioritization-frameworks.md`** — Read when prioritizing which design improvements to tackle first, using Impact/Effort matrices, RICE scoring, MoSCoW scoping, or score-driven gap analysis to plan iteration roadmaps.

**`/references/design-refinement-techniques.md`** — Read when executing specific refinements like typography tuning, spacing standardization, color adjustments, component state completeness, responsive polish, or edge case handling during the final polish phase.
