```
Analyze the following project brief and extract:
1. Primary business goals (what success looks like)
2. Target audience description
3. Key features/functionality needed
4. Brand guidelines or constraints
5. Technical constraints (platforms, frameworks)
6. Timeline and budget considerations
7. Competitive landscape
8. Success metrics

Project brief: [INSERT BRIEF]
```

**Required information to collect:**

| Category | Questions to Answer |
|----------|--------------------|
| Business | What problem are we solving? What are the business objectives? |
| Users | Who will use this? What are their needs? |

| Competitors | Who are the main competitors? |

### Step 2: Analyze Target Audience

**Prompt for audience analysis:**
```
Based on the target audience of [AUDIENCE DESCRIPTION], identify:
1. Demographics (age, location, profession)
2. Technical proficiency level
3. Device preferences (mobile-first vs desktop)
4. Key pain points and motivations
5. Design expectations based on their industry
6. Accessibility considerations
```

### Step 3: Define Design Direction

**Prompt for design direction:**
```
Based on the following project requirements and audience:
[INSERT REQUIREMENTS AND AUDIENCE INFO]

Recommend:

3. Typography character (elegant, friendly, technical, authoritative)
4. Layout approach (dense information, spacious, card-based, etc.)
5. Interaction level (simple, animated, highly interactive)

Provide reasoning for each recommendation.
```

### Step 4: Document Constraints

**Categories of constraints to identify:**

- **Technical**: Browser support, framework limitations, performance requirements
- **Brand**: Existing colors, fonts, logo usage rules
- **Content**: Text length limits, image availability, localization needs
- **Accessibility**: WCAG level required (AA minimum)
