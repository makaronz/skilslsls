## Instructions for AI Agents
### Step 1: Identify Competitors

**Prompt to identify competitors:**
```
For a [PROJECT TYPE] in the [INDUSTRY] space, identify:

1. **Direct Competitors** (3-5): Same product/service, same audience
2. **Indirect Competitors** (2-3): Different product, same audience OR same product, different audience
3. **Aspirational References** (2-3): Not competitors but gold-standard design examples

For each, provide:
- Company/product name
- Website URL
- Why they're relevant to analyze
```

### Step 2: Visual Design Audit

**For each competitor, analyze:**

```
Analyze the visual design of [COMPETITOR URL]:

## BRAND IDENTITY
- Logo style: [Description]
- Brand personality conveyed: [Adjectives]
- Visual tone: [Professional/Playful/Technical/etc.]

## COLOR PALETTE
- Primary brand color: [Hex]
- Secondary colors: [Hex values]
- Background treatment: [Description]
- How color creates hierarchy: [Analysis]
- Accessibility: [Contrast assessment]

## TYPOGRAPHY
- Heading font: [Family, weights used]
- Body font: [Family, size observed]
- Hierarchy approach: [How they differentiate levels]
- Readability: [Assessment]

## LAYOUT & STRUCTURE
- Homepage structure: [Sections in order]
- Navigation pattern: [Sticky/standard, position, items]
- Content density: [Sparse/balanced/dense]
- Grid usage: [Observations]
- White space usage: [Assessment]

## UI COMPONENTS
- Button styles: [Description]
- Card treatments: [If used]
- Form styling: [If visible]
- Icon style: [Outline/filled/custom]

## IMAGERY & GRAPHICS
- Image style: [Photos/illustrations/abstract]
- Graphic elements: [Gradients/shapes/patterns]
- Screenshot treatment: [How product is shown]

## UNIQUE ELEMENTS
- Standout design features: [What's distinctive]
- Micro-interactions observed: [If any]

## STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES
- Design strengths: [What works well]
- Design weaknesses: [What could improve]
```

### Step 3: Comparative Matrix

**Create comparison grid:**

```markdown

## Design Comparison Matrix
| Aspect | [Competitor 1] | [Competitor 2] | [Competitor 3] | Opportunity |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Primary Color | | | | |
| Color Mood | | | | |
| Typography | | | | |
| Layout Style | | | | |
| Visual Density | | | | |
| Imagery Type | | | | |
| Brand Personality | | | | |
| Unique Elements | | | | |
| Mobile Experience | | | | |
| Accessibility | | | | |
```

### Step 4: Identify Patterns & Opportunities

**Prompt for pattern analysis:**
```
Based on the competitive analysis of [COMPETITORS LIST]:

1. **Industry Conventions** (must follow):
   - What design patterns are expected/required?
   - What would confuse users if missing?

2. **Common Approaches** (can follow or differentiate):
   - What do most competitors do similarly?
   - Which of these are best practices vs. just common?

3. **White Space Opportunities** (differentiation):
   - What is NO competitor doing well?
   - What visual territories are unclaimed?
   - How can we stand out while remaining appropriate?

4. **Anti-patterns** (avoid):
   - What mistakes are competitors making?
   - What would our audience dislike?
```

### Step 5: Differentiation Strategy

**Create actionable differentiation plan:**

```markdown

## Differentiation Strategy
### Where to Conform
[Design elements where following conventions is important for usability]

1. [Convention 1]: Why it matters
2. [Convention 2]: Why it matters

### Where to Differentiate
[Opportunities to stand out]

1. **[Differentiation 1]**
   - What competitors do: [X]
   - What we'll do: [Y]
   - Why it's better: [Reason]

2. **[Differentiation 2]**
   - What competitors do: [X]
   - What we'll do: [Y]
   - Why it's better: [Reason]

### Signature Elements
[Unique design elements that will become recognizable]

1. [Element]: [Description and reasoning]
```

## Example Input/Output
### Example Input

```markdown
**Project**: TaskFlow - SaaS project management for creative agencies
**Competitors provided**: Monday.com, Asana, Notion
**Additional to research**: Similar sized competitors in creative space
```

### Example Output

```markdown

## Prompts Library
### Quick Competitor Scan
```
Provide a 2-minute visual assessment of [URL]:
- First impression (3 words)
- Primary color
- Overall style (modern/dated, minimal/busy, premium/casual)
- One strength, one weakness
- Relevance to [OUR PROJECT]
```

### Color Comparison
```
Compare the color strategies of [COMPETITOR 1], [COMPETITOR 2], [COMPETITOR 3]:
1. Primary brand colors
2. How they differ from each other
3. What mood each creates
4. Gap in the color landscape we could fill
```

### UX Pattern Analysis
```
Analyze the [SPECIFIC FLOW: onboarding/checkout/signup] of [COMPETITOR]:
1. Steps involved
2. Design patterns used
3. What works well
4. Friction points
5. How we could improve on this
```

### Differentiation Brainstorm
```
Given that [COMPETITORS] all do [COMMON APPROACH], brainstorm 5 ways we could differentiate while maintaining usability:

1. [Alternative approach]
2. [Alternative approach]
...

For each, rate: Innovation (1-5), Risk (1-5), Feasibility (1-5)
```

## Success Criteria
### Minimum Requirements
- [ ] 3-5 competitors analyzed
- [ ] Visual design elements documented
- [ ] Comparison matrix created
- [ ] Differentiation opportunities identified
- [ ] Clear direction on what to follow vs. differentiate

### Quality Indicators
- [ ] Analysis is objective, not just opinion
- [ ] Specific, actionable insights extracted
- [ ] Differentiation strategy is achievable
- [ ] Balance between convention and innovation

---

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Copying competitors**: Analyze to differentiate, not duplicate
2. **Only looking at leaders**: Smaller competitors may have innovations
3. **Ignoring indirect competitors**: Cross-industry inspiration is valuable
4. **Surface-level analysis**: Dig into WHY designs work, not just WHAT
5. **Analysis paralysis**: Set a time limit, then move forward
6. **Being different for its own sake**: Differentiation must serve users
