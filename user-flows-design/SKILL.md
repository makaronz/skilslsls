# User Flows

Map user journeys and task flows to design intuitive navigation and interaction paths.

# Skill: User Flows

## Overview
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Skill Name** | User Flows |
| **Category** | UX Foundation |
| **Phase** | 2 - UX Foundation |
| **Estimated Time** | 30-60 minutes |
| **Dependencies** | `user_personas.md` |
| **Outputs** | User flow diagrams, journey maps |

## Description
User Flows map the paths users take to accomplish goals within a product. They visualize the steps, decisions, and touchpoints from entry to completion, ensuring designs support efficient, logical task completion.

## When to Use
- After defining user personas
- Before wireframing to plan screen sequences
- When designing new features
- To identify friction points in existing flows
- When optimizing conversion funnels

## Instructions for AI Agents
### Step 1: Identify Key Flows

**Prompt to identify flows:**
```
For [PRODUCT] with these personas:
- [Persona 1]: [Primary goal]
- [Persona 2]: [Primary goal]

Identify the essential user flows to design:

1. **Critical Flows** (must work perfectly):
   - [Flow 1]: [What user accomplishes]
   - [Flow 2]: [What user accomplishes]

2. **Important Flows** (high frequency):
   - [Flow 1]: [What user accomplishes]

3. **Supporting Flows** (occasional but necessary):
   - [Flow 1]: [What user accomplishes]
```

### Step 2: Map Flow Structure

**Flow mapping template:**

```markdown

## Flow: [Flow Name]
### Context
- **User**: [Which persona]
- **Goal**: [What they want to accomplish]
- **Entry Point**: [Where they start]
- **Success Criteria**: [What defines completion]

### Flow Diagram

```
[ENTRY] → [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Decision?]
                                    │
                          ┌────────┴────────┐
                          ▼                  ▼
                     [Path A]           [Path B]
                          │                  │
                          └────────┬────────┘
                                    ▼
                               [SUCCESS]
```

### Detailed Steps

| Step | Screen | User Action | System Response | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | [Screen name] | [What user does] | [What happens] | [Design notes] |
| 2 | [Screen name] | [What user does] | [What happens] | [Design notes] |

### Decision Points
- **[Decision 1]**: [Options available, criteria for each path]

### Error States
- **[Error 1]**: [When it occurs, how to handle]
```

### Step 3: Create Flow Notation

**ASCII flow diagram syntax:**

```
┌─────────┐    Rounded = Screen/Page
│  Screen  │
└─────────┘

┏━━━━━━━━━┓    Double = Entry/Exit point
┃  START  ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━┛

   /\        Diamond = Decision
  /  \
 /    \
 \    /
  \  /
   \/

────▶       Arrow = Flow direction

- - - ▶     Dashed = Optional/alternate path

[⚠️ Error]   Error state
[✓ Done]    Success state
```

### Step 4: Detail Critical Flows

**For each critical flow, document:**

```markdown

## Critical Flow Detail: [Flow Name]
### Happy Path
[Numbered step-by-step for ideal scenario]

1. User arrives at [Entry point] via [Source]
2. User sees [Key elements on screen]
3. User [Takes action]
4. System [Responds with]
5. [Continue until completion]

### Edge Cases
- **[Edge case 1]**: [How handled]
- **[Edge case 2]**: [How handled]

### Error Handling
| Error | Cause | User Message | Recovery Action |
|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| [Error 1] | [Why] | [What user sees] | [What they can do] |

### Screen Requirements
This flow requires these screens:
1. **[Screen 1]**: [Primary purpose]
2. **[Screen 2]**: [Primary purpose]

### Metrics to Track
- Completion rate: [Target %]
- Time to complete: [Target time]
- Drop-off points: [Key monitoring points]
```
