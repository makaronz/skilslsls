# Technical Research & Feasibility Analysis


## Overview

This section provides an overview of the skill.

## Skill Description and Purpose

Technical Research & Feasibility Analysis is a comprehensive evaluation skill that investigates proposed technical solutions, emerging technologies, or project concepts to determine their viability across multiple dimensions. This skill synthesizes technical research, economic analysis, and operational considerations to deliver evidence-based feasibility assessments that inform go/no-go decisions.

The primary purpose of this skill is to reduce investment risk by thoroughly evaluating technical proposals before significant resource commitment. It answers the fundamental question: "Can this be done, and should we do it?" by examining technical achievability, economic viability, operational practicality, and strategic alignment.

This skill should be deployed when organizations are considering new technology adoption, evaluating build vs. buy decisions, planning R&D investments, assessing technical partnerships, or validating product concepts. It is particularly valuable at stage-gate decision points where objective technical assessment can prevent costly failures or, conversely, validate promising opportunities.

The analysis framework examines feasibility through four interconnected lenses: technical feasibility (can the technology work as intended?), economic feasibility (do the costs and benefits justify investment?), operational feasibility (can the organization implement and support it?), and schedule feasibility (can it be delivered within required timeframes?). By rigorously evaluating each dimension, the skill provides balanced assessments that account for both opportunities and risks.

Objectivity is paramount in feasibility analysis. This skill maintains analytical rigor regardless of organizational preferences, providing honest assessments even when findings may challenge assumptions or preferred outcomes. The goal is accurate understanding, not validation of predetermined conclusions.
