## Automation Examples

### Bid Automation

**Rule**: If ACOS > 30% for 7 days, decrease bid by 10%

```python
# Pseudocode
for keyword in keywords:
    if keyword.acos > 0.30 and keyword.days_high_acos >= 7:
        new_bid = keyword.bid * 0.90
        update_keyword_bid(keyword.id, new_bid)
```

### Keyword Harvesting

**Rule**: If search term has 2+ orders and ACOS < 25%, add as keyword

```python
# Pseudocode
for search_term in search_term_report:
    if search_term.orders >= 2 and search_term.acos < 0.25:
        add_keyword(search_term.text, match_type='PHRASE')
        add_negative_keyword(search_term.text, match_type='EXACT', campaign='Auto')
```
