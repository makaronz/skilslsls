# Conversion Rate Optimization

Systematically improve conversion rates through testing and user experience optimization.

## Overview

Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is the systematic process of increasing the percentage of website visitors who complete desired actions through data-driven testing and user experience improvements.

## CRO Fundamentals

### What is Conversion Rate?

```
Conversion Rate = (Conversions / Total Visitors) × 100
```

**Examples**:
- Ecommerce: Purchases / Visitors
- SaaS: Trial signups / Visitors
- Lead Gen: Form submissions / Visitors
- Content: Email signups / Visitors

### Industry Benchmarks

| Industry | Average Conversion Rate |
|----------|------------------------|
| Ecommerce | 2-3% |
| B2B SaaS | 3-7% |
| Lead Generation | 5-15% |
| Travel | 2-5% |
| Finance | 5-10% |

### CRO Process

1. **Research**: Gather quantitative and qualitative data
2. **Hypothesize**: Form testable hypotheses
3. **Prioritize**: Rank tests by potential impact
4. **Test**: Run controlled experiments
5. **Analyze**: Evaluate results
6. **Implement**: Roll out winners
7. **Iterate**: Continuous improvement

## Research and Analysis

### Quantitative Data

**Web Analytics**:
- Traffic sources and volumes
- Bounce rates by page
- Exit pages
- Funnel drop-off points
- Time on page
- Device and browser data

**Tools**:
- Google Analytics 4
- Adobe Analytics
- Mixpanel
- Amplitude

### Qualitative Data

**User Feedback**:
- Surveys (on-site, post-purchase, email)
- User interviews
- Customer support tickets
- Live chat transcripts
- Social media comments

**Behavioral Analysis**:
- Heatmaps (click, scroll, move)
- Session recordings
- Form analytics
- Rage click detection
- Error tracking

**Tools**:
- Hotjar
- FullStory
- Crazy Egg
- Mouseflow
- Lucky Orange

### Conversion Funnel Analysis

**Identify Drop-Off Points**:
```
Homepage (10,000 visitors)
  ↓ 30% proceed
Product Page (3,000)
  ↓ 20% proceed
Cart (600)
  ↓ 50% proceed
Checkout (300)
  ↓ 70% complete
Purchase (210)

Overall Conversion: 2.1%
Biggest leak: Cart to Checkout (50% drop)
```

## Hypothesis Development

### Hypothesis Framework

**Template**:
```
Because we observed [data/insight]
We believe that [change]
Will cause [impact]
Which we'll measure using [metric]
```

**Example**:
```
Because we observed high cart abandonment (50%)
We believe that adding trust badges and security seals
Will reduce anxiety and increase checkout completion
Which we'll measure using checkout conversion rate
```

### Prioritization

**PIE Framework**:
- **Potential**: How much improvement is possible? (1-10)
- **Importance**: How valuable is the page? (1-10)
- **Ease**: How easy to implement? (1-10)
- **PIE Score**: (P + I + E) / 3

**ICE Framework**:
- **Impact**: Expected effect on goal (1-10)
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of success (1-10)
- **Ease**: Resources required (1-10)
- **ICE Score**: (I × C × E)

## A/B Testing

### Test Design

**Elements to Test**:
- Headlines and copy
- Call-to-action (CTA) buttons
- Images and videos
- Form fields and length
- Page layout and design

**Test Types**:
- **A/B Test**: Two versions (A vs. B)
- **Multivariate Test**: Multiple elements simultaneously
- **Split URL Test**: Completely different pages

**Sample Size Calculator**:
```
Required Sample = (Baseline CR, Minimum Detectable Effect, Significance Level)

Example:
Baseline: 2%
MDE: 10% relative improvement (2% to 2.2%)
Significance: 95%
Result: ~40,000 visitors per variant
```

### Statistical Significance

**Requirements**:
- 95% confidence level (standard)
